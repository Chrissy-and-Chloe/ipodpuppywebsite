Hello computer people!

Just settling into my little corner of the internet here—it’s been pretty nice so far! So, what’s the deal with this bad boy (the bad boy being my blog)? The dream is to re-learn Blender, but first, I need a real computer. Right now, everything I do is on my ancient MacBook. And look, this thing is a total beast. Like, if I ever get the battery replaced, she and I would be unstoppable. But until then, I’m forever tethered to the wall by her beloved charging cord. It’s her lifeline. Honestly, it’s kind of poetic if you squint at it… or tragic, depending on the mood.

Anyway, resolutions! Last year, I decided to be meaner. Bold move coming from me. I’ve always been super shy and worried about feeding into the whole "mean lesbian" stereotype (or any dyke-related stereotype for that matter...). A friend's girlfriend felt it was important to tell me she thought I was insecure at a party a week or so ago. I hated how she kept interrupting me and grinning at me as she attempted to give me advice on how to be more confident & hyper-analyze me. What's worse is that she waited until we were alone. I criticized her back (because you don't really know me anyways... wtfreak...), I spoke over her when she spoke over me... I don't know if that's the right way to do it. Standing up for myself has been awesome lol.

So this year? New me, new goals: MONEY. Specifically, making it with commissions. I want to level up from just kinda making money to, like, actual "I can buy my girlfriend something nice" money. (She’s so expensive, I love her lol.) And guess what? The year hasn’t even started yet, and I’ve already made $250. Pawsome..

And I’m also stoked to start blogging here. It’s kind of like journaling, but public. Like, there’s definitely a line I shouldn’t cross (manifestos are a one-way ticket to "the list," right? lol jk… kinda).

Anyway, if you’re into small wins and figuring life out as we go, stick around! 

Cya :P
