hellooooooooooooooo everypony!!!

Today’s been kinda lonely. I was wandering around my house, thinking about all the people who’ve ever been here and where they are now. It’s weird how hard it is to make friends these days.

Anyway, I tried branching out with my art lately, and—plot twist—it backfired. I posted one piece—nothing wild—and lost some mutuals, but I guess I drew the line at… drawing the line? Should I lean into a niche? Now I know you’re thinking, “duh ipodpuppy, your niche is ipods and puppies”. But no!! I don’t want my comics to just echo into the void anymore. I'd really like for people to read them! Relate to them. Laugh. Cry. Who am I even making comics for? Am I funny? Are my comics funny? Hello?????

Okay, existential crisis is over sorry #whateva. I need to keep going! Sometimes I wonder if I’m too scattered, though. Like, I started playing with clay recently—made an epic puppy ashtray—and it was fun, but do I even have the discipline for sculpting? I really hope so. Sometimes, while indulging myself in these hobbies, I get a little voice in the back of my head that’s like, “You can’t have a career in art,” and honestly, it’s probably right! But you know what? That’s okay. It exists for the sole purpose of BUMMING ME OUT. I just hope the career I am pursuing leaves me with enough energy to keep making stuff and things, even if it’s just for me.

I’ve got so many plans and barely enough time for half of them. What I really want is for people to see me for what I am: someone who creates because it’s how I need to be in order to function.

Feeling lonely doesn’t mean I’m alone. As hard as it is to admit. I have my girlfriend, my goals set out, and you reading this. Thanks for sticking around. 

Until next time,
