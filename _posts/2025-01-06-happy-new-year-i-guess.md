Helloooo all
Well, it's 2025! Happy New Year, I guess?
Honestly, this isn’t how I envisioned kicking things off, but sometimes life throws you a curveball, and all you can do is duck and hope it doesn’t take your head off. Without getting too into the gritty details (because trust me, you don’t want to hear the specifics). Life, man!!!!! It’s like biting into a cookie and realizing it’s raisin, not chocolate chip. The world isn't over, but still, it makes me depressed (lowkey).

Here’s the SparkNotes version of my treacherous New Year's Day: I trusted someone and truly admired them wholly, only to find out they were doing a pretty good job rehearsing for the role of a villain in my life. The betrayal ran deep, and the hurt? Deeper still. Trust was broken, lines were crossed, and it got so bad that I found myself Googling “How to rebuild your entire sense of self Reddit 2025.”

So let me run this by you... I’ve been rotting my brain with the following laundry list of questions:

> How do you know when it’s time to kick someone out of your life for good?
> If someone wrongs you, what are the criteria for letting them back in?
> And wtaf do you tell your friends and family who saw you go through the worst of it and might now be silently judging your taste in women? How do you even explain why you stayed so long or how bad it REALLY got?

I keep revisiting these concepts, and I’m no closer to a perfect answer. And as someone who usually prides herself on being a “solution-oriented individual,” I feel like I’ve wandered into uncharted emotional territory. Got an issue? Let’s map it out. Make a plan. Fix it. But this? No amount of logic or strategy could make this less frustrating. The fact that any of this has happened in the first place, coupled with the idea that only time can heal this wound, is seriously killing me.

Now let me focus on what I have figured out for now... Sometimes, the best solution isn’t clarity; it’s acceptance? Right? I used to think that every situation needed a clean resolution, a moral, a clear-cut ending where everyone knows exactly what went down and why. But real life is messy. People are messy. And often, the best you can do is choose yourself in the mess and trust that your gut knows the way out, even if it feels like wading through fog.

As for forgiveness? Don't just let anyone have yours—it’s a personal choice that should never come at the cost of your peace or safety. Letting someone back into your life isn’t about their words or their promises; it’s about their actions and whether they align with the boundaries you set. And let’s be honest: sometimes, the best thing you can do for yourself is to slam the door and walk away, even if it feels like dragging ur heart through 10 miles of broken glass and rubbing alcohol.

To my friends and family who are still dealing with me navigating this situation: I stayed because I wanted to believe in the best version of them. And when that version turned out to be a mirage, I stayed because hope is stubborn like that. But now, I’m learning that love isn’t about martyrdom. It’s about reciprocity, respect, and safety—all things I’ll never compromise on again. Now I’m choosing me. And honestly, it feels like pulling out a splinter that’s been digging into your skin for way too long. It definitely hurts, but OUUUGHH, the relief!!!!!!

So here’s my takeaway: Life is too short to let people turn your heart into a battleground. Set your boundaries, stick to them, and don’t be afraid to burn a bridge or two if it means saving yourself. You’re not a doormat, and you don’t owe anyone a second chance unless they really earn it, and even then, it’s your call.

To anyone else out there struggling to make sense of a mess of crossed boundaries, broken trust, or feeling like you were never a priority, know this: You’re not weak for loving so deeply. You’re also not wrong for wanting more! You’re brave for choosing to love in the first place. It is a wonderful thing to believe in someone and give them a chance. It takes guts to trust, care, and give someone a piece of yourself. But it takes even more to recognize when it’s time to stop and reclaim that piece for yourself.

Because now, you’re not just someone who loved. You’re someone who learned, grew, and is ready to demand the respect and care you deserve.

So here’s to 2025! Standing firm on your boundaries, taking no nonsense, being your own damn hero, and not tolerating anyone who treats your life like their villain arc. Here’s to taking care of yourself, reclaiming your peace, and maybe even enjoying a real chocolate chip cookie along the way!

The raisins might’ve been a disappointment, but we’ll make it work. :D
